Hello guys, I am going to be showing you how to install the lazy-script on kali linux with detailed explaination of each.
* I do not own this project or it's code, I am just giving a tutorial
* Any misuse of this script is not my responsibility
* Do not use this to hack into other people's Wifi etc..
* For using this you need to be lazy as hell
